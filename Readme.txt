This program runs only in a linux environment(since it uses a shell command). It search for strings inside the given virus file
and find out the dll file names and web urls that contains in the virus file. (If the DLLs and URLs
are in the file, there is a high chance that virus will be accessing them).

To run the program,
run,
python virus_scanner.py

then this will ask for a file name. (It takes a file in the same directory)
ex: Enter Filename: virus.exe
